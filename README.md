# Klik
Mouse clicker with custom interval in pwsh and C#.

# How to use
2 versions. Same stuff, different approach. Why not? 
## Pwsh version
1. Just run the pwsh script.
2. If you want a nice executable, use `ps2exe` or `Win-PS2EXE` with `-noConsole` parameter.
3. It uses a simple form, not fancy, but it gets the job done.
## C# version
1. Load the project solution (.sln) file and customise/build/publish.
2. You can make a nice UI.
